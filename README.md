# Path finders
A program that, given a start and an end point, finds a route to it using one of the three algorithms provided, A* search, Dijkstra search or Depth First search.

Both A* and Dijkstra guarantee that the shortest path will be found, the DFS however does not. BFS was not implemented because it would work on the same way as Dijkstra, since the distance between all nodes is 1.
